- 30 X 30 Minesweeper game on Windows Form( Don't ask why it is 30x30)
- Has recursive function for also checking adjacent cells
- Can place flag for mines ( You need to place every flag to end the game)
- Takes mine count from user in the beginning

------------------ PROBLEMS ---------------------------------------
- Sorry for problematic game ( It questioned my sanity )
- Can't compare the images. Because of that game is not ending as intended
- When placed a flag you can't remove it with intended way
